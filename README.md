# Victoria Tech Mentorship List

This is a public list of people in the Victoria tech community that are looking for mentors, available to mentor, or both. If you want to be on this list, issue a pull request. If this gets traction and the community finds this valuable, I'll look into ways of making it more useful then a markdown file!
